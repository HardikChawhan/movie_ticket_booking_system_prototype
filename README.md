# Cinema Ticket Booking System

This C program simulates a cinema ticket booking system where users can view available seats, book seats, cancel bookings, and see the total price for their bookings. The program offers multiple timing options for booking tickets.

## Features

- Display seating arrangement for each timing slot.
- Book seats with a limit of 5 seats per booking.
- Cancel booked seats.
- Calculate and display the total price for the booked seats.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your local machine. You can use GCC for Unix-like systems or MinGW for Windows.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/HardikChawhan/movie_ticket_booking_system_prototype.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd movie_ticket_booking_system_prototype
```

3. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler. For GCC, you can use:
```
gcc movie_booking_system.c -o movie_booking_system
```

This command compiles the main.c file and generates an executable named movie_booking_system.

### Usage

1. Run the compiled executable:
```
.\movie_booking_system
```

2. Choose the timing slot you wish to book tickets for.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to book, cancel, or view seats.
